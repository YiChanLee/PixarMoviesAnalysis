# PixarMoviesAnalysis
This project is initially guided by <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/">Dataquest.io</a>. I try to make it further and put notes so I can have a look if I need. I would be happy if this notebook helps others in learning data analysis with python packages.
The dataset was permitted to download by <a href="https://thelittledataset.com/about/">Alex Albright</a> from her <a href="https://github.com/apalbright/Pixar">repository</a> and reused as a practice for data analysis on Ipython notebook. Please visit her website for nice data visualisation of this dataset.
Any comment and suggestion are welcome.
